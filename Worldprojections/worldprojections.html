    <h1>Lillian Hawkins GEO370 World Projections Homework</h1>

    <h2>In this assignment I learned how to use plugins to create different projections within QGIS.</h2>
    <p> After downloading the data from Sakai, I created a GitHub repository for this assignment, which I then cloned to GitHub Desktop. I have all my folders for this assignment organized within a folder on my external hard drive. I found this keeps my computer running smoothly. To create the maps in QGIS, I started by uploading the Natural Earth Data and activating the Indicatrix Mapper. Then, I changed the EPSG by searching for the values provided in the assignment instructions. Once I had applied the projection to my map, I changed the colors to ensure clarity. I created a new print layout where I formatted the map before exporting it as a png into my maps folder. I labeled all my pngs as their EPSG value.

      </p>

    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>Some observations</h3>
    <p>It appears to be stretched along the parallels. Direction is well preserved and it maintains shape at this global scale, to an extent. Distance appears to be distorted.</p>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>Some observations</h3>
    <p>It appears similar to both the Wagner VII and the Winkle I from first glance. It seems to preserve shape pretty well.</p>

    <h2>Pseudo Mercator</h2>
    <h3>some observations</h3>
    <p> This cylindric projection preserves distance along the equator and seems to keep them pretty conserved for most of the word but there is a noticable distortion along the poles. It's biggest positive is the preservation of direction. One major drawback is that it is not Equidistant or equal area.</p>

    <h2>Sphere Winkle I</h2>
    <h3>Some observations</h3>
    <p>When I went to change the projection and typed in the EPSG provided for the assignment, it registered as an ESRI. I am curious to learn about what the difference between EPSG and ESRI is and if that was a mistake on my part. I did find that the projections with this type of ID code appeared more distorted on the global scale as a flat image compared to the Pseudo Mercator for example. </p>

  <h2>Cylindrical Equal Area</h2>
  <h3>Some observations</h3>
  <p>Unlike the Mercator projection, this one preserves equal area. Shape seems to be well preserved. It seems compressed. </p>

  <h2>World Equidistant Conic</h2>
  <h3>Some observations</h3>
  <p>When I zoomed in on specific regions I saw how this type of projection preserves scale. On the world level it is hard to read but for specific counties or locations it is very clear.</p>

  <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
  <h3>Some observations</h3>
  <p>The Azimuthal Equidistant projection is very interesting to look at on the global scale, similar to the conic in that regard. On a more localized scale, shape and distance seem to be well preserved. </p>

  <h2>Wagner VII</h2>
  <h3>Some observations</h3>
  <p>I chose this projection because I was interested to see how it looked compared to Winkle I. I don't have a great reason behind why I thought they would look somewhat similar other than they both had roman numerals in their name. After I applied this projection however I noticed the similarieties in how it distorted the world. It looks similar to the Aitoff projection as well. </p>

  <h2>Cassini</h2>
  <h3>Some observations</h3>
  <p>This map was a total surprise. When I zoomed in more it began to look more and more normal but it is definitely a projection that is best used on a finer scale. Using it to view the whole world is very difficult to read.</p>
